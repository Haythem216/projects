## About

I'm a CS student with hands-on experience in **C/C++**, **Python**, **Linux**, and **web development**. I enjoy systems and networking: from kernel-level and embedded Linux to user-facing interfaces. This repo holds coursework and personal projects that reflect that range.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Tech |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **[LurkServer](LurkServer/)** | Multi-threaded game server with custom binary protocol over TCP; strict validation to reject malformed/unauthorized traffic. Bash script for process management. | C++, POSIX sockets, pthreads, Linux, Bash |
| **[LurkClient](LurkClient/)** | Graphical client for the above game; parses binary protocol and talks to the C++ server. | Python, PyQt5, sockets |
| **[PDF → Audiobook](ToAudioBookConverter.py)** | Converts PDF text to MP3 using gTTS and PyPDF2. | Python, scripting |
| **[Medical website](MedicalWebsite/)** | Multi-page responsive site (medical/research theme). | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **[Tourism website](tourismWebsite/)** | Multi-page responsive site with media and navigation. | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **[Blender scene](Blender_Final_Proj/)** | 3D scene with Python scripting in Blender. | Python, Blender |

## Skills (aligned with roles I target)
